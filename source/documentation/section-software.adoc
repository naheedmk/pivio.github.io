== Software

To get up and running you need to have the backend server and the client running.
As explained earlier, you strictly do not need the client, you could just send json
or write your own parser for the pivio.yaml file.

=== Building the software

The code is available from the Github repository at: https://github.com/pivio/

- Client: https://github.com/pivio/pivio-client
- Server: https://github.com/pivio/pivio-server
- Web: https://github.com/pivio/pivio-web

All code is written in Java 8 and needs Gradle for building.
Change into each directory and issue ``gradle build`` to compile, test and package. A ``gradlew`` wrapper is provided
if you do not have gradle installed.
The ready to use jar file will be located in ``build/libs``.

=== Client

The client gathers the information about the software. You would run it like this

``
java -jar build/libs/pivio.jar
``

This will

1. look for a ``pivio.yaml`` in the current directory
2. read a generated dependency file from maven, sbt or gradle. You need to generate this information beforehand.
3. read the vcs root information. At the moment git and svn are supported.

At the end everything is converted to json and sent to the server. If none is
specified http://localhost:9123 is assumed.

==== Command Line Options

[source]
----

usage: pivio
 -config <arg>               Defines the config for all parameters. This
                             is a properties file with some the switches
                             listed here. Default location is
                             /etc/pivio-client.properties.
 -defaultconfigname <arg>    Defines the name of your yaml metadata. The
                             suffix '.yaml' will be always appended.
                             Defaults to 'pivio'.
 -dry                        Do a dry run, do not submit anything but
                             output it to stdout.
 -file <arg>                 Full path to a file containing the data in
                             yaml format. Does not have to be named
                             pivio.yaml. This overwrites the -source
                             switch and only information in this file will
                             be collected.
 -generatejsonschema         Outputs the json schema for validation to the
                             current processed yaml file.
 -gitremote <arg>            Uses the given argument as origin for Git VCS
                             remote detection (default: origin). This is
                             useful if you have multiple remotes
                             configured and/or differently named.
 -help                       This Help.
 -manualdependencies <arg>   Defines the file which holds manual defined
                             dependencies. Defaults to:
                             pivio/dependencies.yaml.
 -out <arg>                  Output the generated json to this file.
 -outattributes <arg>        Only output these top level attributes to the
                             outfile, e.g. name,id,runtime.
 -piviofilenotfoundexit0     Fail with Exit(0) when a pivio document was
                             not found in the source directory. Default is
                             1 in such as case.
 -serviceurl <arg>           The url of the pivio service. If this switch
                             is not supplied, no upload will happen.
 -source <arg>               The directory containing the pivio.yaml file.
                             Should be the root directory of the project.
 -sourcecode <arg>           Defines the directory (or comma-separated
                             directories) your source code with the build
                             file is located in. If it is relative path,
                             it is relative to the pivio.yaml file. This
                             switch can also be defined with the
                             'PIVIO_SOURCECODE' environment variable.
 -uploadfailexit1            Fail with Exit(1) when document can not be
                             uploaded. Default is 0 in such a case.
 -verbose                    Prints more information.
 -version                    Shows the version of the client and end the
                             client.
 -yamldir <arg>              All *.yaml files in this directory will be
                             read and each file is treated as self
                             contained definition of an artefact.

Usage: java -jar ./pivio.jar -source /home/ci/source/customerservice

----

You can define certain defaults in a properties file which will be used if it exists. The default location for this is /etc/pivio.properties (can be configured via -config switch).

You can configure the following values:

- source
- gitremote
- serviceurl
- file
- defaultfile
- yamldir
- manualdependencies

The format is key:value as in Java properties files.

==== Exit codes

If a Yaml file is not a valid yaml file the client will exit with code 1 unless the switch ```piviofilenotfoundexit0``` is used (see above).

==== Dependencies & License information

Pivio can leverage exiting tools to gather information about software dependencies and their
license types. At the moment Pivio supports three build tools and their tooling to
get this kind of information.

*Maven*

If your code uses Maven you need to run the following command:
 ``mvn org.codehaus.mojo:license-maven-plugin:download-licenses``.

*Gradle*

To get started with gradle you need to include a plugin in your configuration.

[source]
----

buildscript {
    dependencies {
         classpath 'nl.javadude.gradle.plugins:license-gradle-plugin:0.11.0'
    }
}
apply plugin: 'license'

// most projects doesn't contain a LICENSE file so ignore this step
licenseMain.enabled = false
licenseTest.enabled = false

downloadLicenses {
    includeProjectDependencies = true
    // if you have dependencies but result is empty then use compile instead of runtime dependencies
    // dependencyConfiguration = 'compile'

    // recommend license mapping to avoid duplications
    ext.apacheTwo = license('Apache License, Version 2.0', 'http://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0')
    ext.mit = license('MIT License', 'http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php')

    aliases = [
       (apacheTwo) : ['The Apache Software License, Version 2.0', 'Apache 2', 'Apache License Version 2.0', 'Apache License, Version 2.0', 'Apache License 2.0', license('Apache License', 'http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0')],
       (mit) : ['The MIT License (MIT)', license('New BSD License', 'http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php')]
    ]
}

----
To enable Pivio to use this you need to run: ``gradle downloadLicenses``.

*SBT*

If you use SBT you need to add the following part to one of your build files (e.g. ``license.sbt``).
```
addSbtPlugin("com.typesafe.sbt" % "sbt-license-report" % "1.0.0")
```

Then run ``sbt dumpLicenseReport``.

*Manual License & dependencies information*

You can specify the dependency information in the pivio.yaml file. See <<section-data-format-software-dependencies, Dependencies>> for the format.


*npm*
 
You will need the license-checker to generate the license information into a file named ``dependencies.json``, which must then reside in the same folder as ``package.json``:
 
[source]
----
npm install license-checker
# on same folder as package.json:
./node_modules/license-checker/bin/license-checker --json > dependencies.json
----

=== Server

The server is the backend and uses elasticsearch to store and query the information.
Two rest end-points will be exposed.

- ``/document``
- ``/changeset``

TODO: API


Since the server is using elasticsearch you need to have a running elasticsearch 1.7.x.
Download it from https://download.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-1.7.5.zip .
Unzip it and start it with ``bin/elasticsearch``.

This is how you start the pivio-server:

[source]
----

java -jar build/libs/pivio-server-1.2.0.jar

----

By default it listens on port 9123. The pivio client connects to this server and this port.

[[section-software-webview]]
=== Webview

To start the web view use:

[source]
----

java -jar build/libs/view.jar

----

After that the web view is available on port 8080, e.g. http://localhost:8080 .

The WebView is looking for a configuration for the server in the ``pivio-conf/server_config.yaml`` file.
The default is:

[source,yaml]
----
api: http://localhost:9123/
js_api: http://localhost:9123/
mainurl: http://localhost:8080/
pages:
  - description: Overview
    url: /app/overview
    id: tabOverview
  - description: Query
    url: /app/query
    id: tabQuery
  - description: Feed
    url: /app/feed
    id: tabFeed
----

This describes where all the relevant parts of the pivio components are and how the menu structure should look like.

* ``api`` : The location of the Server Rest API
* ``js_api`` : The location of the Rest API for Javascript, this can be different depending on Virtual Machine / Docker mix
* ``mainurl`` : The location of the main WebView
* ``pages`` : Describes each menu entry with
  ** ``description`` : Text in the menu
  ** ``url`` : The URL of this entry (can be a different machine, like a custom extension)
  ** ``id`` : Id to use for reference


=== Running in Docker

You can mount the ``pivio-conf`` volume with your own configuration file.
